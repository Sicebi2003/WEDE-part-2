Business Proposal. 
 
Efficient Energy is a fully Black-owned business that is located just outside 
Johannesburg CBD and offers products throughout the South African region of 
SADC. The founders of EE (Pty) Ltd have combined their skills within the 
business sector, together with favorable market conditions we will supply the 
demand.  
The vision of EE is to expand beyond only providing wholesalers licenses and 
becoming the owner of the largest mining, storage facilities and distributors in 
the SADC region and Africa. We aim to impact the economy of South Africa, 
through job opportunities and people empowerment. Customer excellence will 
set EE apart from its competition. EE is strategically linked to 
producers/suppliers such as Total SA, Sasol, Afrox, and FuelX. EE will ensure 
no interruption in the supply of its products, making it a dependable supplier to 
the market.

VALUE PROPOSTITION 
 
Efficient Energy (Pty) Ltd aims to provide the most convenient and efficient 
services within the petroleum industry. We offer flexible and responsive delivery 
services for: 
⚫ Hospitals 
⚫ Malls and Shopping Centres 
⚫ Educational institutions 
⚫ Office buildings  
⚫ Individuals 
Load shedding is a major problem in South Africa, where, according to Fraser 
(2023), the entire SA economy loses approximately R650 bn - R850 bn 
(business sector combined) annually as a direct result of these power outages, 
this is R54 Mn monthly. According to Woosey (2023), the current diesel costs 
R25.50. Experts have assessed that this problem will exist for a very long time. 
Efficient Energy aims to reduce these figures significantly. Large enterprises 
(hospitals, malls, and large retailers/wholesalers) spend approximately R12 
000 000 (R1m monthly) on diesel annually, this is 470 600 litres of 50PP diesel 
which is sold at R25.50 a litre. We intend to sell diesel 50PP for R20, which the 
same amount of diesel will cost R9 412 000 (R784 000 per month) annually. 
This will save businesses R2 600 000 annually (R216 700 monthly) and assist 
in saving lives as the lights and machines at hospitals will be operating.  
 
According to Du Toit (2023), individuals spend approximately R18 000 annually 
(R1500 monthly) purchasing diesel and petrol at R25 per litre. We will save 
4 
 
individuals R3000 monthly as they will be spending R1200 at EE (Pty) Ltd; and 
because we deliver, any emergency can be mitigated for our customers, maybe 
the customer ran out of fuel while far from any filling stations, our fast team will 
make sure that the car is filled, and the customer is ready to continue with their 
journey.  
 
FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES 
The suggested website would be a dynamic, user-focused platform made to 
improve customer service and directly assist business expansion. The following 
will be important features:  
 
Customer Portal: A safe login space where both individual and business clients 
may manage their account information, schedule recurring deliveries, view 
order history, and track live deliveries. 
Online Quotation and Ordering System: A user-friendly form that enables 
clients to enter their delivery address, fuel type, and amount to obtain an instant 
price and make an order straight from the website. 
Live Chat Support: Including a live chat function on important pages (for 
example, by utilizing the WhatsApp Business API or a special chat widget) to 
offer prompt assistance for questions and urgent orders.

DESIGN AESTHETIC 
The website's design will prioritize usability while being contemporary, expert, 
and representative of the energy industry. The following will define the aesthetic:  
 
Colour Scheme: A primary palette of orange which represents energy and 
action and dark blue which represents dependability and trust, with neutral 
whites and grays added for a polished, tidy appearance. 
Typography: To guarantee superior reading on all platforms, use clear, 
readable fonts for headings and body text, such as a sans-serif typeface like 
Open Sans or Montserrat. 
Imagery: Custom iconography to visually assist users, along with high-quality, 
professional images showing our services in action such as fuel delivery trucks, 
happy business clients, and operating generators.

Current Website Analysis 
 
Now, Efficient Energy runs a simple informational webpage.  Although it offers 
broad information on the business and its offerings, a number of flaws restrict 
its usefulness: 
 
• Static pages with outdated designs that don't encourage interaction. 
• Inadequate mobile responsiveness, which limits smartphone users' 
accessibility. 
• Limited resources for interacting with customers, like newsletters, live  
chat and order forms. 
• Poor search engine optimization (SEO), which indicates that the brand 
is not as well-known online as its rivals. 
 
Making a brand-new, completely dynamic website is crucial for these reasons.  
The proposed website would enhance customer involvement, modernize the 
company's online presence, and offer features that complement Efficient 
Energy's expansion plans in South Africa and the SADC.
